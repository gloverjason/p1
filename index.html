    <h2>About Me</h2> 
    
    <p>Hi,<br/><br/> My name is Jason Glover. I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in Digital Media Design. 
    This is my second semester at Harvard Extension School. Last semester, I took CSCI E-3 and CSCI E-12. 
    From those classes, I learned a great deal about front end development. I’m taking this class so I can 
    learn more about back end development.  In my free time, I like exercise, reading, hiking, and skiing. 
    I look forward to taking this class with you-all.
    <br/><br/>
    Jason</p>
